Aja-PHM is a modeling platform for AmyClientele
==Introduction to Tweepcraft==

Tweepcraft is a mesh editing application in development for posable human models (PHM). It is compatible with COLLADA based meshes and Python based scripts. 

Our flagship model kit, 'AmyClientele' features different PHM designs and is ethnically balanced to encompass over seven different races.

Character kits such as "Amy, the Release" and a host of library scripts, textures and FBM/BM/HM content are in development mode and new builds are in production currently.

Tweepcraft also features the Antonia Polygon model and content that will be updated frequently. Testing of new features and compatibility will be the main goals. Periodic content drops of additional free material will be available for all registered members to use.

Tweepcraft is maintained at GitHub and exhibited at Deviant Art via API (Coming Soon).
